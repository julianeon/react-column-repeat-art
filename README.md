This project was bootstrapped with create react app, I used yarn.

## Comments

I have an alternate version that continuously changes the number of components (alternate_app) but it's too much: this is better looking and more comprehensible.

As always, I ran out of time, but you can see what I did here: used bootstrap's columns and iterated through them to make this little art piece. Try changing the values and see how it changes things.
